# Problem 4
A new car that is a gas - and electric - powered hybrid has recently hit the market. The distance travelled on 1 gallon of fuel is normally distributed with a mean of 45 miles and a standard deviation of 8 miles. Find the probability of the following events:

A. The car travels more than 48 miles per gallon.
Probability = 1 - pnorm(48, 45, 8)
0.2118554

B. The car travels less than 40 miles per gallon.
Probability = pnorm(40, 45, 8)
0.08075666

C. The car travels between 40 and 49 miles per gallon.

# Problem 5
(1 point) A soft drink bottler purchases glass bottles from a vendor. The bottles are required to have an internal pressure of at least 150 pounds per square inch(psi) . A prospective bottle vendor claims that its production process yields bottles with a mean internal pressure of 157 psi and a standard deviation of 3 psi. The bottler strikes an agreement with the vendor that permits the bottler to sample from the production process to verify the claim. the bottler randomly selects 50 bottles from the last 10000 produced, measures the internal pressure of each, and finds the mean pressure for
  the sample to be 0.8 psi below the process mean cited by the vendor.

(a) Assuming that the vendor is correct in his claim, what is the probability of obtaining a sample mean this far or farther below the process mean ?
pnorm(157 - 0.8, 157, 3 / sqrt(50))
(b) If the standard deviation were 3 psi as claimed, but the mean was 150 psi, what is the probability of obtaining a sample mean of 156.2 psi or below ?
pnorm(156.2, 150, 3 / sqrt(50))
(c) If the process mean were 157 psi as claimed, but the standard deviation was 3.9 psi, what is the probability of obtaining a sample mean of 156.2 psi or below ?
pnorm(156.2, 157, 3.9 / sqrt(50))

# Problem 6
The distance some top - selling tires can run until wear - out is a normally distributed random variable with a mean of 80000 miles and a standard deviation of 9000 miles.

A. What is the probability that a tire will travel more than 67400 miles before wear - out ?
Probability = 1 - pnorm(67400, 80000, 9000)

B. What is the probability that a tire will travel less than 69200 miles before wear - out ?
Probability = pnorm(69200, 80000, 9000)

D. How many miles before wear - out a tire has to travel so that is at the top 15 % of all tires ?
Miles = qnorm(1 - 0.15) * 9000 + 80000

# Problem 8
An airline company is considering a new policy of booking as many as 195 persons on an airplane that can seat only 180.(Past studies have revealed that only 86 % of the booked passengers actually arrive for the flight.) Estimate the probability that if the company books 195 persons, not enough seats will be available.
1 - pnorm(180, 0.86 * 195, sqrt(195) * sqrt(0.86 - 0.86 ^ 2))
Hint:Define Xi to be 0, if the ith passenger does not arrive and 1, otherwise. What is the mean and standard deviation of Xi ?
